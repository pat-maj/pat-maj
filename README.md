# 👋 Hi there, I'm Patryk!
I'm currently a dedicated second-year student at Manchester Metropolitan University, where my journey is deeply rooted in the fascinating world of web and software development. My academic and personal explorations have led me to a passionate intersection of backend and full-stack development, with a keen interest in creatively solving complex problems through code.

## 👀 What I'm Passionate About
Professionally, I thrive on web development, backend engineering, and the collaborative spirit of creating innovative solutions with a team. My toolkit includes Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Firebase, and dabbling in C# and AI technologies, reflecting my enthusiasm for both learning and applying cutting-edge technologies to real-world applications.

What fills my time outside coding is personal growth, fitness, reading, sports, go-karting, Formula 1, video gaming, and travel. All of them are collectively contributing to both my professional and personal development.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
My second year at MMU is an exciting adventure, diving deeper into Java, JavaScript, and various modern web technologies. I'm not just learning; I'm seeking to apply this knowledge practically, especially interested in backend and full-stack projects that challenge me to grow.

## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate
I would also like to consider some projects or initiatives to expand with my back-end and full-stack development skills. Open for co-working, internships, or part-time engagements—I would appreciate learning from experienced peers and applying my fast learning and adaptiveness in any team.
